            <p>What is a Datalet?</p>
            <p>Datalets are similar to Bookmarklets, however</p>
            <p>Instead of injecting JS code it runs HTML code</p>
            <p>Also it opens a about:blank with that code instead of directly injecting it</p>
            <p>Datalets can be used like <code>data:text/html,</code></p>
            <p>Then using script tags we can execute JS code</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>So far what I've managed to make using Datalets are</p>
            <p>- Forkbomb (funny)</p>
            <p>- History Flooder</p>
            <p>- Tool for Bypassing Securly for Classrooms</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>The Bypass for Securly (aka Cekzu) works by exploiting the fact that Securly cannout access about:blank tabs</p>
            <p>It works by have the user input a site and iframe styled to be fullscreened</p>
            <p>Securly cannot view about:blank tabs so you can access a site without the teacher seeing</p>
            <p>However sites are still blocked as Securly uses webRequests for blocking sites</p>
            <p>Securly cannot access about:blank tabs as they are treated as chrome:// pages which extensions cant access due to security reasons</p>
