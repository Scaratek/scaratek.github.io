        <section>
            <p>Pollen is a Bash Script that allows users to modify their schools Chromebook User Policies</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>Chrome OS has a undocumented feature that allows you to create a JSON file with policies</p>
            <p>Once you have the JSON file you can write the file to a directory in CrOS that over writes the current policies</p>
            <p>It works similar to Crome policies on Windows</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>With this knowledge we can make a Bash Script</p>
            <p>That creates a JSON file and overwrites the current one</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>Although we need to use a special method to apply the JSON file</p>
            <p>As you cannot overwrite the file directly as it is protected by RootFS</p>
            <p>The side effects of this is that you need to apply Pollen every time you boot the Chromebook</p>
